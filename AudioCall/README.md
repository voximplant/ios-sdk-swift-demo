# Voximplant Audio Call Demo (iOS)

This demo demonstrates basic audio call functionality of the Voximplant iOS SDK. The application supports audio calls between this iOS app and other apps that use any Voximplant SDK.

> This demo application doesn't handle push notifications, so it doesn't receive incoming calls if the application is in the background or killed.

#### Features
The application is able to:
- log in to the Voximplant Cloud
- make an audio call
- receive an incoming call
- put a call on hold / take it off hold
- change an audio device (speaker, receiver, wired headset, bluetooth headset) during a call
- mute audio during a call
- send DTMF
- auto reconnect/relogin


## Getting started

To get started, you'll need to [register](https://voximplant.com) a free Voximplant developer account.

You'll need the following:
- Voximplant application
