# Voximplant Video Call Demo (iOS)

This demo demonstrates basic video call functionality of the Voximplant iOS SDK. The application supports video calls between this iOS app and other apps that use any Voximplant SDK.

> This demo application doesn't handle push notifications, so it doesn't receive incoming calls if the application is in the background or killed.

#### Features
The application is able to:
- log in to the Voximplant Cloud
- auto login using access tokens
- make an video call
- receive an incoming call
- put a call on hold / take it off hold
- change an audio device (speaker, receiver, wired headset, bluetooth headset) during a call
- switch camera during a call
- mute video during a call
- send DTMF
- auto reconnect/relogin
